# About
The project is at its core a node editor for gradient noises. It includes some preset noises and a collection of operations to combine, mix and match different noises with a custom node editor that instantly shows all changes. The goal is to easily experiment to find noise types that you want to achieve without having to change values in code for every slight adjustment.
